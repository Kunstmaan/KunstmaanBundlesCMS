Select2 Documentation
=====================
This repository holds the latest documentation for [Select2][select2].

What is this?
-------------

The documentation is automatically extracted from the `docs` directory at the
[Select2 source repository][select2-source]. This is done periodically by
the maintainers of Select2.

**Pull requests will usually be ignored, documentation fixes should be made in
the source repository.** We _may_ accept pull requests if they match the
source `docs` directory, but for the most part pull requests will be closed on
sight.

How can I build these docs manually?
------------------------------------
In the [main Select2 repository][select2-source], you can build the
documentation by executing

```bash
grunt docs
```

Which will start up the documentation on port 4000. You will need
[Jekyll][jekyll] installed to build the documentation.
