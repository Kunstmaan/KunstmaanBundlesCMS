# Chainrouter implementation in NodeBundle

The KunstmaanNodeBundle implements the [Symfony CMF](http://cmf.symfony.com/) [RoutingExtra](https://github.com/symfony-cmf/RoutingExtraBundle) bundle.

## Chainrouter?

The default Symfony 2 router does not support multiple routers. To allow more flexibility, the Symfony CMF Chainrouter was chosen to support multiple routers. An example of the flexibility gained is the KunstmaanNodeBundle:SlugController routing was changed to no longer allow routing inside entity objects. This was previously needed to achieve some goals but can be replaced by adding a custom router.

## Implementation

* Composer.json now includes a dependency for "symfony-cmf/routing-extra-bundle".
* The config.yml includes the required configuration values for "symfony_cmf_routing_extra".
* There is an extra service in services.yml called "kunstmaan_node.slugrouter".

## Adding a router

To add a router simple create a service and tag it with 'router' and a priority. The default Symfony 2.1 router has priority 100. For more information about the Chainrouter see the official Symfony CMF [RoutingExtra documentation](http://symfony-cmf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/bundles/routing-extra.html).

## SlugController and SlugRouter

The SlugController is now accessed through the SlugRouter (Kunstmaan\NodeBundle\Router\SlugRouter) and handles locales and multilanguage support. The SlugRouter will need to have 2 or 3 settings in order to route the requests in the correct manner to the SlugController:

* multilanguage: is the first parameter in the url a language or not?
* defaultlocale: the default locale if the website is not multilanguage or there is no language given
* requiredlocales: used to validate the language given in the url, required only for multilanguage sites

If an url is requested and there is no language or slug given, the system will fall back to the default locale and an empty slug ('').
