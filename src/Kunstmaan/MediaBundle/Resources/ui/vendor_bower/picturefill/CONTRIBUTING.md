## Project Scope
Picturefill aims to polyfill the standard features of the `picture` element and related `srcset`, `sizes`, `type`, and `media` attributes (some of which work on `img` elements without a `picture` parent as well). Issues and contributions that fall outside of this scope are not likely to be accepted by the project. Some exceptions include workarounds that improve browser support for standard features.

## Working on Picturefill

### Issue Discussion

General Picturefill discussion takes place in Slack, at [http://picturefill.slack.com](http://picturefill.slack.com). To join, send an email to `picturefill` at `ricg.io`. Discussion of issues pertaining to the responsive images specifications takes place in the [RICG IRC channel](irc://irc.w3.org:6665/#respimg) and [issue tracker](https://github.com/responsiveimagescg/picture-element/issues/).

You can connect to the Picturefill Slack channel [via IRC](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201727913-Connecting-to-Slack-over-IRC-and-XMPP) (SSL enabled).

### Modifying the code
First, ensure that you have the latest [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) or [io.js](http://iojs.org) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) installed.

Test that Grunt's CLI is installed by running `grunt --version`.  If the command isn't found, run `npm install -g grunt-cli`.  For more information about installing Grunt, see the [getting started guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

1. Fork and clone the repo.
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies (including Grunt).
1. Run `grunt` to grunt this project.

Assuming that you don't see any red, you're ready to go. Just be sure to run `grunt` after making any changes, to ensure that nothing is broken.

### Development Workflow

**Note**: The `master` branch now represents the publishing branch. Anything on master should be publishable to npm and bower. When something goes into master, it gets published. Minor version branches (`2.2`, `2.3`, etc) also exist to capture in-progress work on a particular version of picturefill. Once work on a version branch is complete, it gets merged into master to be published.

1. If no issue already exists for the work you’ll be doing, create one to document the problem(s) being solved and self-assign.
1. Create a new branch based off of the minor version branch you're fixing (`2.3`, `2.2`, etc) — please don't work in the `master` branch directly. We recommend naming the branch to match the issue being addressed (`issue-777`).
1. Add failing tests for the change you want to make. Run `grunt` to see the tests fail.
1. Fix stuff.
1. Run `grunt` to see if the tests pass. Repeat steps 2-4 until done.
1. Open `test/*.html` unit test file(s) in actual browsers to ensure tests pass everywhere.
1. Update the documentation to reflect any changes.
1. Push to your fork or push your issue-specific branch to the main repo, then submit a pull request against the minor version branch you're fixing. `2.2`, `2.3`, etc.
1. Once tested and +1’d by another team member (with no outstanding objections), self-merge into the branch specified in the pull request.
1. Once ready to release to the public, merge the minor version branch into master and publish to npm and create a tag for bower.

### Versioning

The rules of [semver](http://semver.org/) don’t necessarily apply here in the case of major releases (as a polyfill for a stable spec, we _shouldn’t_ have breaking changes), so we’re using the following:

1. MAJOR versions at maintaners’ discretion following significant changes to the codebase (e.g. refactoring core)
1. MINOR versions for backwards-compatible enhancements (e.g. performance improvements)
1. PATCH versions for backwards-compatible bug fixes (e.g. spec compliance bugs, support issues)

### Important notes

Please don't edit files in the `dist` subdirectory as they are generated via Grunt. You'll find source code in the `src` subdirectory!

#### Code style
Regarding code style like indentation and whitespace, **follow the conventions you see used in the source already.**

#### PhantomJS
While Grunt can run the included unit tests via [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), this shouldn't be considered a substitute for the real thing. Please be sure to test the `test/*.html` unit test file(s) in _actual_ browsers.
