    on_exit_intent:
        sensitivity_info: The popup fires when the mouse cursor moves close to (or passes) the top of the viewport. You can define how far the mouse has to be before the popup fires. The higher value, the more sensitive, and the more quickly the event will fire. Defaults to 20.
        timer_info: Set a min time (milliseconds) before the popup fires. By default, the popup won't fire in the first second to prevent false positives, as it's unlikely the user will be able to exit the page within less than a second. If you want to change the amount of time that firing is surpressed for, you can pass in a number of milliseconds to timer.
        delay_info: By default, the popup will show immediately. You could instead configure it to wait x milliseconds before showing the popup. If the user's mouse re-enters the body before delay ms have passed, the popup will not appear. This can be used to provide a "grace period" for visitors instead of immediately presenting the popup.
