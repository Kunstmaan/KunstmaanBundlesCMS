# hostname is probably 'localhost:8000' or '0.0.0.0:8000' when you run app/console server:run.

# files_path is the directory where your assets are located that are used for the backend tests. The backend tests require this to be set.
# This should be something like '/../../src/ProjectNamespace/YourCustomBundle/Features/Media/'

# multilanguage is again used for the backend tests. The site can be set up either multi-language or single-language.
# This variable has to match how your site is configured.
# For example when you use multiple language it has to say 'multi'.
# If your site is single-language it has to say 'single'.
