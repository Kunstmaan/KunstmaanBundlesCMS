UPGRADE FROM 5.5 to 5.6
=======================

General
-------

* SearchBundle/NodeSearchBundle: Support for ruflin/elastica and elasticasearch 7 was added. If you still use
elasticsearch 6 you should add `"ruflin/elastica": "^5.0|^6.0"` to your project `composer.json`.

SearchBundle
------------

* Support for `ruflin/elastica` and elasticsearch versions below 7 is deprecated and will be removed in 6.0. Upgrade to `ruflin/elastica` ^7.0 and elasticsearch 7.

MediaBundle
------------

* The controller method "KunstmaanMediaBundle_media_bulk_upload_submit" is now POST only.
This call now also requires a mandatory header called "x-upload-token" The content of this header
should be a csrf token generated by the Symfony csrf service using the name "bulk-upload-media".
This header is an added security layer to avoid unintended and malicious uploads.

UserManagementBundle
------------

* Using the deleteAction method from the UsersController is deprecated since KunstmaanUserManagementBundle 5.6 and will be replaced by the method deleteFormAction in KunstmaanUserManagementBundle 6.0. Use the correct method instead. The new action is POST only and will have correct csrf protection.
