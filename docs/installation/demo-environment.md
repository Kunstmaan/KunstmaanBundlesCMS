# Running the Demo Website inside a docker environment

We provide a docker-compose.yml file inside our [standardedition](https://github.com/Kunstmaan/KunstmaanBundlesStandardEdition).

Assuming you have already set up docker on your computer, booting up the demo is a matter of 2 simple commands.

```bash
#In the KunstmaanBundlesStandardEdition
cd docker_demo
docker-compose up
```

An exact copy of te demo website will be available at localhost:2468 now. Also there will be a maildev available at localhost:1080.
