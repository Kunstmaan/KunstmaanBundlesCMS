# Getting started

## Read and learn from the documentation

The Kunstmaan Bundles CMS is built on top of the Symfony 2 Full Stack framework and wants to be as close to the philosophy and way of working of Symfony itself. This means that knowledge of Symfony is a prerequisite for a succesful deployment, the official guides from Symfony should be a good starting place.

* [The Book](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/index.html)
* [The Cookbook](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/index.html)
* [Best Practices](http://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices/index.html)
* [The Symfony Components](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/index.html)

We can also recommend investing some time in reading these books:

* [Matthias Noback - A Year With Symfony](https://leanpub.com/u/matthiasnoback)
* [Matthias Noback - Principles of PHP Package Design](https://leanpub.com/principles-of-package-design)

> Writing documentation is hard. Especially if the writer is fully into the topic at hand. This results in the glossing over of obvious information for the writer, that might not be obvious for everyone else. We wholeheartedly appreciate pull requests or suggestions for this documentation.
