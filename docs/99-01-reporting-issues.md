# Reporting issues

## Reporting a bug

Whenever you find a bug in the Kunstmaan Bundles CMS, we kindly ask you to report it. It helps us make a better content management system.

> !! If you think you've found a security issue, please use this [special procedure](#reporting-a-security-issue) instead.

Report your bug to in [the issue tracker at Github](https://github.com/Kunstmaan/KunstmaanBundlesCMS/issues) and follow some basic guidelines:

* Use the title field to clearly describe the issue;
* Describe the steps needed to reproduce the bug with short code examples
  (providing a unit test or demo that illustrates the bug is best);
* Give as much detail as possible about your environment (OS, PHP version,
  Symfony version, CMS version, enabled extensions, ...);

## Reporting a security issue

If you think that you have found a security issue in the KunstmaanBundlesCMS, don't use the issue tracker and don't publish it publicly. Instead, all security issues must be sent to bundles [at] kunstmaan.be. We will contact you as soon as possible to get it resolved.
