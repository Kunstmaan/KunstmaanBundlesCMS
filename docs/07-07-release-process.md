# Release process

Regarding our release process, we are implementing a flexible approach with limits. We will also follow the Symfony releases.
This means that we will do a minor/major release when Symfony does.

## Major releases

A major release will be done every 3 to 9 months. This will depend on the submitted BC breaks
on the master branch. When we reach 10 BC breaks, the 9 month limit or Symfony does a major release, than a new release 
will be made. 

For our major release we want to implement a feature freeze and will do an RC release first. After a month 
we will do a final release.


## Minor releases

A major release will be done every month, if necessary. This depends on the new features that are introduced and when
Symfony does a minor release.


## Patch releases

A patch release will be done every 2 weeks, if necessary. This depends on the bugfixes that are submitted.
